                <p>My name is Travis. I am a Dad by trade, but in the meantime I aim to put food on the table by working as a Software Engineer. Currently I am working as a Fiber Engineer in Boulder, and learning how to build websites/webapps at the DU Bootcamp. I think it is important to blaze a trail that my daughter is proud to follow which is why working hard is my priority. Web development is fastly becoming a passion of mine, I went to school for Mechanical Engineering and in the process was exposed to trace amounts of programming. Taking stuff apart, and putting it back together has always something that has interested me, so naturally seeing behind the scenes of this vast connection we all have known as the interet is one of the most interesting ventures I have undertaken. So theres a brief intro to Me thanks for taking the time to learn a little about me. Feel free to peruse this page and get a little bit of technical perspective of the aforementioned... me.</p>
